This is repository where I play around with data structures in C
### Done:
> All you see listed in the folders;
### To do:
> Graphs;
### Mentions:
> The implementations aren't extraordinary, this repository was made for me to understand the logic behind each and every one of these structures in a fundamental way, mostly because C doesn't have them implemented in any way, so you have to do everything from the bottom up. Also, one of the files is C++, I forgot to change it and I can't be bothered to do it for now;
